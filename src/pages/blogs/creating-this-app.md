# How I created this blog

I was working on another app when I thought that maybe... I should create my own blog!

I already know how to use [Astro](https://astro.build) and I thought this should be easy. I first implemeted dark mode and made an about page. Then I learned how to display markdown in astro and wrote some code in [/src/blogs/index.astro](../blogs/index.astro) to get the markdown files and display them using the built-in card component(it is in the astro demo template) in the blog menu(which was a little difficult, but ChatGPT wrote it for me). At last, I built a navbar and it was done!

Building this blog have helped me learn new things and get more experienced. I like creating apps and check out [my other app](https://todo-project-bosco0808.vercel.app)!
