# Three Keys to Learning English

Winning the "_Best of the Best_" award in _TOEFL Junior_ was a tremendous honor. Through my journey, I've discovered three essential keys to mastering English: **passion**, **persistence**, and **practice**

Firstly, **passion drives progress** is very important. Passion gives us motivation to work hard. For me, I immerse myself in English through books, songs and movies. Passion makes the learning process enjoyable and helps you overcome challenges along the way.

Secondly, **persistence is essential**. Persistence means not giving up, even when progress feels slow or mistakes happen. By staying persistent, you can overcome obstacles and keep moving forward, no matter how difficult the journey may seem. For me, I always dedicate time daily to reading, writing, listening and speaking English for at least 20 minutes each day.

Last but not least, **practice makes perfect**. I actively use English &mdash; speaking without fear of mistakes, listening to English TV programs, writing journals, and thinking in English.

English is not just a subject. It is a bridge to global opportunities. With these keys, I'll keep unlocking new horizons!

<!--
With dedication to these three keys—passion, persistence, and practice—anyone can make steady progress in learning English. Remember, every small effort adds up over time. Stay motivated, keep practicing, and enjoy the journey!
